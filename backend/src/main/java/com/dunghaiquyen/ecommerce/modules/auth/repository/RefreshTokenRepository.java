     *
     * Known tradeoff: this also fires when a request simply lost the one-time-use
     * race below (see revokeIfActive) rather than a genuine stale-token replay -
     * the schema has no parent/child link between a token and its rotated
     * successor, so there is no race-free way to tell the two apart without
     * adding one. Left unscoped intentionally: narrowing it by timestamp was
     * tried and rejected because it also excluded a user's later legitimate
     * sessions from a genuine theft response (verified by testing), which is a
     * worse failure mode than the rare case this causes (a concurrent duplicate
     * /refresh call forcing re-login).
